			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				I am a technical writer <em>by trade</em> and front end web developer
				<em>por pasi√≥n</em>. I am really into reading the docs, writing
				the docs, CSS, and accessibility. I have worked at tech
				companies since 2015.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whenever I am not at work I listen to punk records and ride
				bikes as often as possible. No gods, no masters, no electronic
				shifting.
			</p>
			<h2>About this site</h2>
			<p>
				The web should work for everyone and I have done my best to make
				this site work for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am attempting to grow a digital garden with this space, so the
				content may shift around a bit and flow between work ideas and
				not-so-work ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				I built this site with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> and
				<a href="https://cube.fyi/">CUBE CSS</a>, which is a CSS
				methodology that I'm really into. I wrote a how-to guide about
				my process <a href="/">here</a>.
			</p>
			<h2>Contact me</h2>

				You can send me an <a href="mailto:email@example.com">email</a>.
