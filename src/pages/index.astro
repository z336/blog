					<h2>About me</h2>
					<p>
						I am a technical writer <em>by trade</em> and front end web
						developer
						<em>por pasión</em>. I am really into reading the docs,
						writing the docs, CSS, and accessibility. I have worked
						at tech companies since 2015.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whenever I am not at work I listen to punk records and
						ride bikes as often as possible. No gods, no masters, no
						electronic shifting.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am attempting to grow a digital garden with this
						space, so the content may shift around a bit and flow
						between work ideas and not-so-work ideas.
					</p>
